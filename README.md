# Bootstrap-Portfolio

 # Portfolio
    This is my ongoing portfolio

    -- Update Version 2.
        I have updates the website to include images, icons and most importantly I have implemented bootstrap.
        The website follows the same template however has been change visually since version 01.

# Navigation bar

    At this point only the 3 basic pages of about, portfolio and contact are added to the navigation bar but more can be added and decided at a later date.

    -- Update Version 2.
        * Since version 2 I have changed the cosmetic and technical structure of the navigation bar. It is now using a bootstrap navbar, the text font has changed to be more unique and give character to the website as a whole.
        * The link navigation have all been changed to buttons following the website's character scheme with additions of dropdowns and onclicks to auto scroll to correct locations.
        * Current there is a issue with the *about me* modal execution, the modal backdrop does not allow interaction and closure, will need further investigatiom.


# Hero Container

    At this point the hero container has my name, titles and plain solid orange. A portfolio and contact me button will be added at a later date and the placemnt of text might be changed.
        -- Update Version 2.
       * The new hero container is now using bootstrap's jumbotron with two buttons that are the most important and directs the users eyes.

       * the background is no loner a solid orange and now more dynamic than before giving it character.


# Project boxes

    At the moment only basic containers exist with place holder information, this is to be updated as the projects and course progresses. More boxes can be added as well.
            -- Update Version 2.
            * The project boxes are now using bootstrap's card's and are now visually more interesting.

            This area is still underconstruction and will only start to be built once projects are added.

# Contact info

    The contact information are to be updated later with social buttons and more information as the project progresses.
            -- Update Version 2.
            * The contact section now uses a form componant and is easier to navigate.
            * I have included 3 input areas and one text area that allows the user to include long form enquieries.

# Social Footer

    This area is new and includes 3 socials LinkedIn, Github and Twitter (X), these socials will eventually need to be hyperlinked to the appropriate social accounts.
    This area will still need to be looked at, at a later date.
